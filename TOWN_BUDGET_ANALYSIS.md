### 🟡 4. OVERALL SPENDING: Lower Total Per-Resident Cost

**Issue:** Eastchester has lower total spending per resident, which may indicate underfunding

- **Eastchester:** $1,250.00/resident
- **Comparison Average:** $1,910.26/resident (Scarsdale: $2,500, Pelham: $1,384.62, Larchmont: $1,846.15)
- **Difference:** $660.26 less per resident
- **Percentage:** 52.8% below average

**Impact:**
While lower spending can indicate efficiency, it may also mean:
- Lower service levels across the board
- Less investment in municipal improvements
- Fewer amenities and services
- Potential for service quality issues

**Why This Matters:**
Eastchester spends 52% less per resident than the average of comparable towns. While this could be good (efficiency) or bad (underfunding), the fact that it's combined with low spending in key areas (parks, public works) suggests underfunding rather than efficiency.

### 🟡 5. ADMINISTRATION: Relatively High Administrative Costs

**Issue:** Eastchester's administrative costs are higher relative to its total budget

- **Eastchester:** $187.50/resident (15% of budget)
- **Comparison Average:** $244.62/resident (Scarsdale: $300, Pelham: $193.85, Larchmont: $240)
- **Difference:** While lower in absolute terms, it's a higher percentage of a smaller budget

**Impact:**
- More of each tax dollar goes to administration rather than direct services
- Less efficient use of taxpayer funds
- Higher overhead costs relative to service delivery

**Why This Matters:**
When you have a smaller total budget but similar administrative costs, it means less money is available for actual services. Eastchester spends 15% of its budget on administration, which is proportionally higher than towns with larger budgets.

## Summary: What Eastchester Residents Should Know

### The Good News:
- ✅ Lower total spending per resident (could indicate efficiency)
- ✅ Lower debt service burden (12% vs 15-16% in comparison towns)

### The Concerns:
1. **Parks & Recreation is severely underfunded** - 181% below average
2. **Public Works spending is below average** - 21% less
3. **Public Safety spending is below average** - 30% less
4. **Overall spending is 53% below average** - may indicate underfunding
5. **Administrative overhead is proportionally high** - less money for services

### Key Takeaway:

Eastchester residents pay less in town taxes per resident ($1,250 vs $1,910 average), but they're also receiving significantly fewer services, particularly in:
- **Parks & Recreation** (3.75x less than Scarsdale)
- **Public Works** (infrastructure maintenance)
- **Public Safety** (police coverage)

This suggests Eastchester may be **underfunding services** rather than being more efficient. Residents might want to question whether the lower taxes are worth the reduced service levels.
